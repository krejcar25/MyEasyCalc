Yet Another School Calculator Invention

Thanks for downloading this software, we really appreciate it!
Let me quickly show you how to install and use this program:

***INSTALLATION***
1. Extract the archive you downloaded from GitHub.com.
2. Inside you will find a folder named version, such as x.x.x.x. You can safely rename this.
3. After renaming you can move the folder somewhere out of sight, such as "C:\Program Files\"
4. Create a shortcut to the progrem by right clicking the file YASCI inside the folder we renamed.
5. Name the shortcut something cute and fluffy such as "My Beloved Calculator" and hiit Enter. Then drag it to your Desktop
6. Et Voilá, you are done and you can use MyEasyCalc from now on, arent you happy?

***UPDATING***
For now, updating is done just the same way installation is, only you have to delete the previous MyEasyCalc folder.
Sadly, this will delete your configuration, but I promiss, we are working on a proper updater! Stay tuned!

***USAGE***
The app is very intuitive, as any other calculator. Most of the buttons are on-screen for your usage and more functions are comming with every
release. You can configure keyboard shortcuts by going to Options and Choosing Keybindings.
